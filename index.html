      <h1>Saturn and it's Rings</h1>

    <section class="left">
      <p>Saturn has the most extensive and complex ring system of any planet in the Solar System. The rings consist of particles in orbit around the planet and are made almost entirely of water ice, with a trace component of rocky material. </p>

    <section class="light">
      <p>Though light reflected from the rings increases Saturn's apparent brightness, they are not themselves visible from Earth with the naked eye. In 1610, the year after his first observations with a telescope, Galileo Galilei became the first person to observe Saturn's rings, though he could not see them well enough to discern their true nature</p>

    <section class="left">
      <p>The rings have numerous gaps where particle density drops sharply. Two of these are cleared by moons embedded within them, and many others are at locations of known destabilizing orbital resonances with the moons of Saturn. Other gaps remain unexplained. Stabilizing resonances, on the other hand, are responsible for the longevity of several rings, such as the Titan Ringlet and the G Ring. Well beyond the main rings is the Phoebe ring, which is believed to originate from Phoebe and thus shares its retrograde orbital motion. It is aligned with the plane of Saturn's orbit. Saturn has an axial tilt of 27 degrees, so this ring is tilted at an angle of 27 degrees to the more visible rings orbiting above Saturn's equator.</p>
